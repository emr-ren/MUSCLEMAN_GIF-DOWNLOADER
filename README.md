# MUSCLEMAN_GIF-DOWNLOADER
 Effortless file downloader from URLs.


I made this code to download non-downloadable gifs, but you can also use it to download any ...
For instance, if you want to save a GIF from Canva's website but it downloads as a photo when you select the save option, MUSCLEMAN_GIFDOWNLOADER should be used.

Example Site= https://www.canva.com/features/free-gifs/
Our goal is the 'cat' gif on this site
